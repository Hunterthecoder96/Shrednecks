                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the garlic, rosemary, vinegar, and a pinch of salt and cracked pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes to allow the aromatics to soften and infuse the butter, but don’t let the milk solids toast; reduce the heat if needed.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the heat and transfer to a small glass container to cool, then refrigerate to set. Before using, stir the butter to re-emulsify the butterfat and milk solids. Store the butter in the refrigerator and use within 3 days, or freeze for use later on.</li>
                        <li>At least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before you plan to cook, remove the meat from the fridge and let it come to room temperature. If you’re using a large tenderloin from an animal like an elk or nilgai, cut it in half so that it fits in the skillet for searing, if needed. Season both sides of the meat with salt and pepper just before cooking.</li>
                        <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat and cook trout cakes for 4-5 minutes or until lightly browned and heated through</li>
                        <li>Heat a wide skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add enough tallow or oil to lightly coat the bottom. Working in batches if needed, lay the tenderloins in the pan, leaving a little space between them, and sear for 1 to 2 minutes on the first side, then flip and sear on the second side for 1 to 2 minutes. Flip back to the first side and sear for another couple of minutes, then flip again and sear for another minute or two (so each side has been seared twice).</li>
                        <li>In the final minute of cooking, drop 2 tablespoons of the garlic compound butter into the pan. Let the butter melt and foam, then tilt the pan and use a spoon to scoop up the melted butter and baste the top of the meat repeatedly.</li>
                        <li>Test for doneness by pressing tongs into the meat. The density should feel similar to the flesh of your palm when your thumb and middle finger are pressed together, or you can check with a meat thermometer-you’re aiming for medium-rare, about 130°F. The whole process may take 5 to 6 minutes for a deer tenderloin, or about 8 for elk.</li>
                        <li>Transfer to a cutting board to rest, uncovered, for 8 minutes. Pour the melted butter from the skillet across the meat and slice to serve.</li>

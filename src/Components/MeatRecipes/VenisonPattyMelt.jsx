                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Begin with caramelizing the onion. Heat up a large cast iron skillet to medium-high with enough high-heat oil to coat the bottom. Add the onions, stirring frequently until they begin to slightly brown, then turn the heat down to medium-low. After about 10 to 15 minutes of occasional stirring, the onions will begin sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add a pat of butter and scrape the bottom. Cook until the onions reach a mostly uniform light-brown color—season with a pinch of salt and set aside.</li>
                        <li>You can patty the burgers while the onion is cooking (just be mindful that you keep stirring them periodically). Mix the grind with Worcestershire sauce, a pinch of salt, and a few good cracks of pepper. Combine well, form into balls, and smash into patties about ¼-inch thick. (I like to place the patties on parchment paper for seamless transfer to a hot skillet without breakage.)</li>
                        <li>When you’re ready to cook the burgers, add enough bacon grease (you can sub beef tallow, duck fat, etc.) to coat the bottom of the cast iron you just cooked the onions in, and heat on medium-high. Cook the burgers hot and fast. Because they’re so thin, they’ll be done in only a couple of minutes. Be sure you’re not overcrowding your pan, that's a surefire way to not get the Maillard reaction you’re looking for. Cook in batches for best results.</li>
                        <li>Once the burgers are cooked, wipe your cast iron out and turn your burner on medium heat. Butter the outside of the rye, and assemble the melt to your liking with layers of patty, cheese, and onion (sauce is optional). Cook it like you would a grilled cheese—until the bread is toasted and cheese is melted. Serve it up with chips or fries, your beverage of choice, and a cheers to leveling up classic diner fare with the meat sourced by your own sweat equity.</li>

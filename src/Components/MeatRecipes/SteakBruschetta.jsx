                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To caramelize onion: In a skillet, add a tablespoon of oil over medium to medium-low heat and add sliced onion with a pinch of salt. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent, and then add sugar. Next, allow onion to caramelize slowly by stirring only occasionally. Adjust heat as needed to prevent burning, and when the onion begins to look dry or is darkening too quickly, add a splash of water to deglaze the pan. This process could take 30 minutes. Don’t rush it by turning up the heat.</li>
                        <li>Dry venison with paper towels and season with salt and paper. In a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat, add oil and cook venison until the internal temperature reaches 127°F. Transfer venison to a plate and allow to rest loosely tent with foil. (If the venison steak is very thick, you might want to finish it in a 300-degree oven.)</li>
                        <li>In the same pan, add more oil and cook mushrooms over medium-high until browned. Deglaze the pan with a splash of whisky. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper and toss with butter. Keep warm.</li>
                        <li>Slice the baguette on the bias into ½- to ¾-inch slices. Brush with olive oil and toast in an oven or on a grill to your liking. Thinly slice venison across the grain. Top bruschetta with caramelized onion, mushrooms, venison, blue cheese, a dab of fruit preserves, chives, and a sprinkle of finishing salt.</li>

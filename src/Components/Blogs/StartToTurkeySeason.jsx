            <p>The start of the Wednesday morning I awoke with a text message from ole Patty boy saying "change of plans were going on the hunt this Thursday",  I was struck by confusion.  As Thursday morning comes I gave Ole Patty a call he said "you don't remember making plans to head into the woods with me?" I replied no as it vaguely rejogged my memory.  I then agreed to go on the hunt. </p>
